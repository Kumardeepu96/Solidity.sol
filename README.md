# Tokenforassessment Smart Contract

## Overview

This Solidity smart contract defines a basic ERC-20-like token named "cryptokitties" with the symbol "kitties". The contract allows minting and burning of tokens, which adjusts the total supply accordingly. This contract is designed for educational purposes, focusing on the core concepts of token management on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Contract Details

### Public Variables

- **Tokenname**: The name of the token is `cryptokitties`.
- **Tokenabbr**: The abbreviation (symbol) of the token is `kitties`.
- **Totalsupply**: The total supply of the tokens in circulation. It is initially set to 0 and will change as tokens are minted or burned.

### Mapping

- **balances**: A mapping from an Ethereum address to its corresponding balance of `kitties` tokens. It is used to keep track of how many tokens each address holds.

### Functions

#### 1. `mint(address _address, uint _values)`

- **Purpose**: This function is used to mint new tokens.
- **Parameters**:
  - `_address`: The address to which the newly minted tokens will be credited.
  - `_values`: The number of tokens to be minted.
- **Functionality**: 
  - Increases the `Totalsupply` by the specified `_values`.
  - Increases the balance of the specified `_address` by the same `_values`.

#### 2. `burn(address _address, uint _values)`

- **Purpose**: This function is used to burn (destroy) tokens.
- **Parameters**:
  - `_address`: The address from which the tokens will be burned.
  - `_values`: The number of tokens to be burned.
- **Functionality**:
  - Checks if the balance of the specified `_address` is greater than or equal to `_values`.
  - If the condition is met:
    - Decreases the `Totalsupply` by the specified `_values`.
    - Decreases the balance of the specified `_address` by the same `_values`.
  - If the condition is not met, the burn operation is not executed.

## Usage

To use this contract, you can deploy it on the Ethereum blockchain using any Solidity-compatible development environment like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.

### Minting Tokens

You can mint new tokens by calling the `mint` function with the appropriate address and value parameters. This will increase the total supply of the token and credit the specified address with the newly minted tokens.

### Burning Tokens

To burn tokens, use the `burn` function with the appropriate address and value parameters. This will reduce the total supply of the token and decrease the balance of the specified address. The function ensures that the address has enough tokens to burn; otherwise, the operation will not be executed.
